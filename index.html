	<h2>About Me</h2>
	<p> I am a NASA Einstein postdoctoral fellow in astrophysics working at 
	the <a href="http://www.jpl.nasa.gov">Jet Propulsion Laboratory</a> and
	the <a href="http://www.caltech.edu">California Institute of Technology</a> 
	as part of the <a href="http://www.tapir.caltech.edu">TAPIR</a> group.</p>
	</header>
	<p>  My research is primarily focused on the development of Bayesian data 
	analysis techniques for pulsar timing array science including 
	gravitational wave detection, noise characterization, non-linear timing, 
	and interstellar medium characterization. I am a member of the North 
	American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational
	Waves <a href="http://www.nanograv.org">(NANOGrav)</a> and the 
	International Pulsar Timing Array <a href="http://www.ipta4gw.org">(IPTA)</a>.
	Check out my <a href="#three">Research</a> page for more information about my work.
	</p>
	<p> I am also very interested in machine learning and data science. 
	I have done some work to classify pulsar and quasar candidates using 
	various machine learning techniques. In my spare time I like to find 
	interesting public datasets and extract valuable information. </p>

			<h4>Gravitational Waves</h4>
			<p> <span href="#" class="image left"><img src="images/gw.jpg" alt="" /></span>
			Gravitational waves (GWs) are tiny ripples in the fabric of 
			spacetime that are produced by accelerating masses, typically 
			binary systems of compact objects such as black holes, neutron
			stars, or white dwarfs. GWs are an important prediction of 
			Einstein's General Relativity (GR) and were recently detected by 
			the <a href='https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/news/ligo20160211'>LIGO Collaboration</a>. 
			Detecting and characterizing GWs across a broad frequency range 
			will allow us to more fully test GR and will open a new 
			observational window into the universe.</p>

			<h4>Pulsar Timing Arrays</h4>
			<p> <span href="#" class="image left"><img src="images/pta_champion.jpg" alt="" /></span>
			Pulsars are rapidly rotating, highly magnetized neutron stars 
			that emit a beam of radiation along the magnetic field axis. Some
			pulsars have spin periods of milliseconds and are known as 
			millisecond pulsars (MSPs). The rotations of these pulsars are 
			extremely stable and allow us to use them as clocks. By measuring
			the train of pulses from the pulsars and constructing a physical
			model for the pulses, we can learn about the pulsars's orbital
			dynamics and intrinsic properties, the interstellar medium (ISM),
			and even fundamental physics and alternative theories of gravity.
			By observing a collection of MSPs we will be able to measure
			the spatially correlated effects of GWs and we will gain insights
			in to the orbital dynamics and environmental effects of 
			supermassive black hole binaries.</p>

			<h4>Data Analysis</h4>
			<p> <span class="image left"><img src="images/data_analysis.jpg" alt="" /></span>Data analysis is the method by which we make inferences about 
			nature based on a set of observations. In many cases we are 
			presented with noisy or incomplete data and must develop techniques
			to deal with these obstacles. In many cases, 
			<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_inference'> Bayesian analysis</a> 
			is well suited for this task. In other cases we have large data sets that we use to make 
			predictive models for future observations. Several types of 
			<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning'>machine learning</a> 
			are well suited to this problem.</p>
